"""M02: every named pose of both arms (and both grippers) plans and executes in Gazebo at option B's baseline configuration, through
move_group, with a final joint error below 0.01 rad, at lift stop L1000.

S8 with the lift planned (issue #17): lift_joint is a planned joint with a gz_ros2_control interface and lift_controller. The run is M01's
(a7_support.run_s8): both arms to `park`, the lift PLANNED from L1000 to L1175 and back (only between the stops, only with the arms reading
`park`: the register LIFT rule as scenario design, not an interlock), then the twelve poses at L1000. The lift's state is the physics'.

The stack is `moveit.launch.py sim:=gazebo headless:=true`: Gazebo Harmonic (server only), the base on platform-sw's DiffDrive plugin, the
arms and the lift on gz_ros2_control, the six controllers, move_group on the simulator's clock.

THE PHYSICS ENGINE: this test passes `physics_engine:=gz-physics-bullet-featherstone-plugin` explicitly. sim.launch.py defaults to DART (the
engine platform-sw tuned the base on; decided 6 Oct), and on DART the fingers do not follow the position command at the default gain and
`finger_joint2` has no mimic constraint, so a `closed` gripper pose would not close. The arm poses do not depend on the engine; the gripper
poses do, and they are part of what this check is for (the per-hand sign, live). That is the same reason G02 passes the engine. What was
and was not compared on DART: see the gazebo package's README.

`simulation` class: it says how the model behaves in this simulator on this machine, under the Gazebo position interface (a velocity
servo), and nothing about a physical robot or its limits. The acceleration limits MoveIt plans under are engineering defaults (ADR-009).
